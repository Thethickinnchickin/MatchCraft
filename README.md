🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This
(optional but powerful: a short paragraph about why you built it, what you learned, what you’d improve next)

📌 Final Tip
Once you polish & deploy it:

Add the GitHub repo to your portfolio site

Write a short LinkedIn post about building it

Practice explaining it in interviews (“here’s the problem it solves, how I approached it, and what I learned”).

If you want, I can also draft the full README.md text for you in ready-to-paste markdown — just say the word!
